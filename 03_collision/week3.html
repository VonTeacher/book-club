    Welcome to week 3

    This week, we're diving into the creation of a tile platformer game. Think Mario 1 or Metroid 1

    Game Map Structure:

    Our game world is constructed from a 2D array, where each element represents a tile in the map:
    - An 'x' denotes a solid block, a surface on which the player can stand.
    - An 'o' represents an empty space, through which the player can move freely.

    For example, the array below:

    [
        ['o', 'o', 'o'],
        ['o', 'o', 'o'],
        ['x', 'x', 'x']
    ]

    Creates a map with a solid floor at the bottom, offering a clear visual foundation for our game's layout.

    Starter Code Overview:

    We provide you with starter code that sets up the essential elements:
    - A canvas to display our game.
    - A game loop to keep the action moving.
    - Map reading functionality that draws our game world.
    - A map (map1.js)
    - A player character, complete with basic physics, and keyboard control to navigate through this world.

    Your Mission:

    Your task is to enhance our game with collision detection. Ensure the player:
    1. Does not fall through the blocks but lands firmly on them.
    2. Can jump from one block to another.
    3. Implement your logic in the "COLLISION CODE" section marked bellow. Do not modify any other code.

    Extra credit: Make another version and modify/add anything you like

    Refer to the included video for a clearer understanding of how these interactions should look and feel in the final game.

    Happy Coding!
